# Requirement Analysis in Software Development 

Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the system development life cycle that focuses on identifying, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified system. It's essentially the process of figuring out "what" the system needs to do before figuring out "how" it will do it.

During requirement analysis, analysts work closely with users, customers, and other stakeholders to gather detailed information about their goals, the problems they face, and the functionalities they desire. This involves various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, prototyping, and observation. The output of this phase is typically a set of clear, concise, and verifiable requirements that serve as the foundation for design, development, and testing.

## What is Requirement Analysis ?

Requirement analysis, also known as requirements engineering, is a fundamental phase in the development of any system, particularly in software engineering and systems engineering. It's the process of determining, documenting, analyzing, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product, system, or project.
